# Logistic-Regression-From-Scratch

Implementing logistic regression from scratch with different optimization algorithms such as batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent and Newton's method. The implementation was tested using Kickstarter dataset against logistic regression from sklearn as benchmark.
